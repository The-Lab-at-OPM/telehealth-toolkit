As of 10/04/2018, this wiki reflects the work done for the Telehealth Toolkit Workshop, 10/02/2018. It does not reflect the research and development of the Telehealth Toolkit site itself, conducted between 11/2017 - 09/2018.

## Overview
Drawing on the qualitative research generated in the winter and summer of 2018, a VEO and Lab team developed the Telehealth Toolkit product for VHA's Office of Telehealth. The Toolkit is, essentially, a documentation site modeled on the moderated, contributory method of content generation practiced in long-established industries such as magazine publishing and technology. This workshop was the first meeting of the Editorial Workgroup for this Toolkit. It sought to:
1. Establish the workgroup and its mission
2. Map out the current process for content generation
3. Map out an ideal process for content generation
4. Generate next steps for the workgroup in terms of editorial and technical needs

## Introductions: Roles, Challenges, & Current Improvement Efforts
Since the Workshop pivoted around bringing together a diverse group from across the Telehealth community, the particpants started by bringing each other up to date on their individual roles and responsibilities, their main challenges, and the means by which they and their local telehealth groups were working to improve or extend telehealth within their catchment areas.

Participants Included:
* Office of Telehealth Leadership
* Quality and Training Team members (Program Office)
* Facility Telehealth Coordinators (FTCs)
* Telehealth Clinical Technicians (TCTs)
* Providers

Some of the challenges the participants expressed were:
* Lack of time for building/expanding the Telehealth program
* Communications challenges: functional formal channels versus ad hoc and personal ones
* Keeping Leadership up-to-date on the expanding abilities and needs of a Telehealth staff
* Physical Space
* Marrying metrics and care-giving

Some individual and local efforts at increasing the impact of telehealth offerings included:
* Changing providersâ€™ attitude to telehealth
* FTCs acting as mentors to other telehealth staff
* Introducing telehealth during the onboarding process
* Embedding telehealth in PACTs
* Emphasis on Veteran experience during first visit; 60-minute visit
* Promoting access through telehealth in terms of clinical-, educational-, and outcome-based evidence

## Exploring a Contributory Model for Telehealth Documentation
Through real-world examples, the group learned how an editorial workgroup could work to produce more useful, up-to-date, and multi-faceted documentation for the Office of Telehealth. Including how to manage submissions and grow an engaged community of contributors.
